# ETX Signal-X

Consistency is key.

Millions of bug bounty and security writeups exist.
Most techniques are scattered, repetitive, or buried in noise.

You can’t read all of them. I couldn’t either.

So I built an automation.

**ETX Signal-X** is a **daily intelligence digest**:
- 10 security articles per day  
- AI-summarized  
- Techniques extracted  
- Focused on signal, not noise  
- No beginner-level content, no filler

This repository is powered by my custom automation (which hopefully won't break randomly).

Daily in. Daily out.
